# ALC Render Quick Start

`alc-render` composes a frozen `ac-document` `RichDocument` and optional
source-bound overlay Layers into a standalone HTML reader. It does not discover
or parse a source itself.

## Run ALC Render

Use `ac-document` and `alc-render` directly when they are on `PATH`. Check once:

```bash
ac-document export-rich-document --help
alc-render --help
```

If a bare command is unavailable, use the portable Skill runtime:

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/alc-runtime ac-document export-rich-document --help
<skill-dir>/scripts/alc-runtime alc-render --help
```

Inside an ALC source checkout, the package virtual environment is the direct
development fallback:

```bash
<alc-venv>/bin/ac-document export-rich-document --help
<alc-venv>/bin/alc-render --help
```

Use the selected launcher in place of the bare command below. Do not search
package internals for another executable.

## Build a Source-Only Reader

First export a local Markdown, HTML, or flattened single-file TeX source into a
new or empty publication directory:

```bash
ac-document export-rich-document note.md --output-dir publication
```

Add `--validator note.pdf` when a PDF should validate fidelity or page mapping.
The command creates `publication/rich-source.json`,
`publication/metadata.json`, and `publication/resources/`. It verifies and
copies source assets and writes their complete metadata, so do not copy figures
or hand-author a `resources` array afterward.

Compose the smallest valid publication with no overlays:

```bash
alc-render compose \
  --source publication/rich-source.json \
  --metadata publication/metadata.json \
  --output publication/publication.json
```

Render and validate the standalone reader:

```bash
alc-render render \
  --publication publication/publication.json \
  --html publication/reader.html

alc-render validate \
  --publication publication/publication.json \
  --html publication/reader.html
```

Keep `publication.json`, every Layer, every referenced fragment revision, and
all declared resources below the same publication root. Relative paths in the
publication are resolved from the directory containing `publication.json`.

## Add Overlay Layers

`--layer` is optional and repeatable; command-line order is publication order.
Every Layer file must be below the output publication directory and must bind
the exact `RichDocument`. Its referenced `fragments/` files must also be present
below that root. When reusing a standalone `alc-translate` result, copy
`translation.layer.json`, `translation.glossary.json`, and the complete
`fragments/` tree into the exported publication directory without changing
their relative paths. Do not copy only the Layer. Compose with:

```bash
alc-render compose \
  --source publication/rich-source.json \
  --metadata publication/metadata.json \
  --glossary publication/translation.glossary.json \
  --layer publication/translation.layer.json \
  --layer publication/companion.layer.json \
  --output publication/publication.json
```

`--glossary` is required for a visible standalone translation glossary. It
binds the exact source and block anchors. Compose fails closed on another
source, unknown anchors, or non-empty metadata glossary instead of overwriting
either input.

A Layer outside `publication/` is rejected even when its contents are valid.
Do not move only a Layer while leaving its referenced revisions elsewhere.
A Companion layer is optional: source-only and source-plus-translation
publications can both be rendered and exported as standalone HTML.

## Read Command Results

`ac-document export-rich-document` returns the typed ALC command envelope. Check
top-level `status`, `warnings`, and `error`. On success, use:

- `data.source`: absolute `rich-source.json` path;
- `data.metadata`: absolute `metadata.json` path;
- `data.resources[]`: copied resource metadata and absolute paths;
- `data.document_digest`: frozen rich-document digest;
- `data.warnings[]`: parse and reconciliation warnings.

Successful `alc-render` commands print one flat JSON object with these exact
fields:

| Command | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `compose` | `publication`, `publication_digest`, `source_document_digest`, `layer_count` |
| `render` | `html`, `publication_digest`, `selected_revision_digests`, `warnings` |
| `validate` | `publication`, `publication_digest`, `warnings`; plus `html` when supplied and `browser` when requested |
| `standalone-html` | `html` |

Paths identify written or checked files. Preserve render and validation
`warnings`; an empty list is the clean result.

## Validate in a Browser

Ordinary `validate` checks the publication workspace and, with `--html`, binds
the standalone reader to that publication. Add an optional local Chromium check
for reader behavior:

```bash
alc-render validate \
  --publication publication/publication.json \
  --html publication/reader.html \
  --browser \
  --browser-timeout 60
```

`--browser` requires `--html`. Use `--browser-executable <path>` only to select
a particular Chromium-family executable. Successful browser validation adds
`browser.executable` and `browser.timeout_seconds` to the flat result.

## Inline an Existing HTML Bundle

Use this separate operation when an existing local HTML entry point already
loads local CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, media, or attachments:

```bash
alc-render standalone-html bundle/index.html standalone.html
```

It embeds local automatic resources into one offline file. External navigation
links remain links, but external automatic resources such as remote scripts,
stylesheets, or images are rejected. This does not compose or validate an ALC
publication; use `compose`, `render`, and `validate` for a native ALC reader.

## Browser Editing and Export

In an ALC reader, click a translation, companion, guide, or note body to edit
its raw Markdown. Only one draft may be active. Selecting another fragment
automatically cancels an unchanged draft. If the current draft has unsaved
changes, the reader blocks the switch, scrolls the existing editor into view,
and focuses it. Advanced exposes the complete title, Markdown, preview,
metadata, revision history, and appearance controls; closing it returns unsaved
values to the inline editor. Cancel discards the draft. Unchanged Save is
disabled and creates no revision.

Notes default to black with white text. Any fragment type can use a paired
color preset or a custom foreground/background pair. The color picker and
`#RRGGBB` text field stay synchronized; resetting uses the current role's
default. New saves use fragment revision v2 for this optional appearance, while
existing v1 revisions remain readable.

A changed Save uses the revision snapshot already loaded by the browser,
writes and verifies one new immutable fragment revision, then refreshes only
the affected fragment and reading chunk. Later directory refresh incorporates
revisions written by other processes and reports forks. Directory changes,
and exports wait until the active draft is saved or cancelled.
Reading mode shows each fragment role and revision numbers greater than 1;
editing also shows priority and revision. Toolbar status messages clear after
ten seconds.

The directory action is `New save location` until a project directory is
connected and `Change save location` afterward. Export refreshes that directory
first. Per-role Markdown export may include all latest selections or only
changes from the embedded baseline. Full-text HTML export is always complete
and available only for all-latest export from a standalone reader.

Large readers render the initial view first, then nearby and idle-time chunks.
Contents links and URL fragments materialize their target before scrolling.
Native find covers the complete document after background rendering; printing
forces remaining chunks to render. On desktop, drag the contents sidebar's
right edge to resize it from 12rem up to the smaller of 32rem or 45% of the
viewport. Dragging below the minimum collapses it to the contents button; that
button restores the previous width. The choice lasts only for the current page.

The speaker icon (`Listen` tooltip) uses Chrome's Web Speech API without
embedding audio or a speech model. Select source, translation, Companion,
guide, note, or any discovered custom role. Play begins at the first selected
readable row in the current viewport, then reads one existing source block or
overlay fragment at a time. Code, display equations, and table bodies are
skipped. The panel offers system voice, rate, previous/next, pause/resume, and
stop controls. If the browser has no usable system voice, it reports that
limitation and leaves all other reader features available.

## Printing

`alc-render` does not currently provide an automated PDF command. Open the
standalone HTML in Chrome and use Print / Save as PDF. Print styling hides
editing/navigation controls and stacks source and overlay blocks vertically.
The PDF is a user-created derivative: ALC does not validate, reproduce,
publish, or provide durability guarantees for it.
